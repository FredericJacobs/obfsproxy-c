How to Set up a Tor Client with obfsproxy (managed proxy mode)
==============================================================

[1] You will need:

* a copy of obfsproxy:
  git clone git://git.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
  Build it with: "./autogen.sh && ./configure && make".
  You will need libevent-2 to build it.

* a copy of Tor that supports the managed ClientTransportPlugin
  option. The current git master should work.

[2] Set up tor:

You should put the following lines in your torrc file:
"""
SocksPort 5000
UseBridges 1
Bridge obfs2 <bridge address>:1051 # This is provided by the bridge operator.
ClientTransportPlugin obfs2 exec <path to obfsproxy> --managed
"""
where <path to obfsproxy> is the path to the obfsproxy executable. If
you successfuly compiled obfsproxy, the executable should be in the
obfsproxy directory.

[3] Done!

To test it, launch Firefox and set it up to use a SOCKS server on
127.0.0.1:5000. Now browse the web.
