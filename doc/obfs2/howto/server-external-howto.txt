How to Set up a Tor Bridge with obfsproxy (external proxy mode)
===============================================================

[1] You will need:

* a copy of obfsproxy:
  git clone git://git.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
  Build it with: "./autogen.sh && ./configure && make".
  You will need libevent-2 to build it.

* a copy of Tor that can be configured as a bridge.

[2] Set up obfsproxy:

This command will setup an obfsproxy server speaking the obfs2
protocol:

./obfsproxy obfs2 --dest=127.0.0.1:5001 server 0.0.0.0:1051

Be sure to pass the value of ORPort of your bridge relay to the --dest
argument (see next section). In this example, we assumed it was '5001'.

[3] Set up tor:

You should put the following lines in your torrc file:
---
ORPort 5001
BridgeRelay 1
ExitPolicy reject *:*
---

[4] Done!

Now, instruct censored people to connect to your IP on port 1051. So,
for example, if your bridge's address is 192.0.2.42, bridge users
should connect to 192.0.2.42:1051.

During the above process, you can use any port numbers you want, but
make sure to adjust the torrc and obfsproxy commands accordingly.

Finally, don't forget that you might also need to set up port
forwarding.
