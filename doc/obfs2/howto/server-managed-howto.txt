How to Set up Tor Bridge with obfsproxy (managed proxy mode)
============================================================

[1] You will need:

* a copy of obfsproxy:
  git clone git://git.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
  Build it with: "./autogen.sh && ./configure && make".
  You will need libevent-2 to build it.

* a copy of Tor that supports the managed ClientTransportPlugin
  option. The current git master should work.

[2] Set up tor:

You should put the following lines in your torrc file:
"""
ORPort 5001 # Port on which bridge will be listening on.
BridgeRelay 1
ExitPolicy reject *:*
ServerTransportPlugin obfs2 exec <path to obfsproxy> --managed
"""

[3] Launch tor

Now launch tor and monitor your logs.
You should see a message similar to:

"[warn] Registered server transport 'obfs2' at '0.0.0.0:33578'"

note down the port number ('33578' in this case). It's the port number
that you should tell your bridge clients to use.

[4] Done!

Now, instruct censored people to connect to your IP on the port you
found in the previous step (e.g 33578).  So, for example, if your
bridge's address is 192.0.2.42, bridge users should connect to
192.0.2.42:33578.

Tor will try to always spawn your transport proxy at the same port, so
you won't have to do this procedure in every Tor restart.

Finally, don't forget that you might also need to set up port
forwarding.
