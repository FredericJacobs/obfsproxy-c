How to set up Tor Client with obfsproxy (external proxy mode)
=============================================================

[1] You will need:

* a copy of obfsproxy:
  git clone git://git.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git
  Build it with: "./autogen.sh && ./configure && make".
  You will need libevent-2 to build it.

* a copy of Tor that supports the ClientTransportPlugin option.
  Any Tor version newer than 0.2.3.2 will do the trick.

[2] Set up obfsproxy:

This command will setup an obfsproxy client speaking the obfs2
protocol:

./obfsproxy obfs2 socks 127.0.0.1:1050

[3] Set up tor:

You should put the following lines in your torrc file:
---
SocksPort 5000
UseBridges 1
Bridge obfs2 <bridge address>:1051 # This is provided by the bridge operator.
ClientTransportPlugin obfs2 socks5 127.0.0.1:1050
---
substituting <bridge address> with the IP address of your bridge
relay.

[4] Done!

Now to test it, launch Firefox and set it up to use a Socks server on
127.0.0.1:5000. Now browse the web.
